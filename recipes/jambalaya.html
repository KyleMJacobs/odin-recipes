        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Jambalaya is a Cajun dish made of rice and some combination of meat
            and/or seafood. It's usually made in one pot.

            Often compared or confused with Gumbo, Jambalaya is different from Gumbo
            in a few ways. Gumbo is more like a stew and served over just a bit of rice,
            wheras with Jambalaya the rice is cooked in the pot with everything else. Jambalaya
            is usually much thicker than Gumbo for this reason.
